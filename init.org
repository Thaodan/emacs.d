* About
  This is my Emacs configuration based on various snippets around the internet.
  The refactor in an org-mode based approach is heavily inspired by Dakra's [[https://github.com/dakra/dmacs/][Dmacs]].

** Installation
   This config doesn't use ~package.el~ as package management but
   [[https://emacsmirror.net/manual/borg/][borg]] which uses git submodules.
   After first cloning this repository you have to call ~make bootstrap-borg~
   to download the `borg` library and the you can execute ~make bootstrap~
   to tangle this file and initialize all packages.
   After that you can just call ~make~ to tangle and rebuild the packages
   each time you make a change or ~make build-init~ if you only made
   changes to this file.

   If you want to check this file can be build before pushing
   you call install the hook in [[file:misc/git-hooks/pre-push][./misc/git-hooks/git/pre-push]] to run
   ~make build-init~ before each push.
   You can install the hook by executing [[file:misc/autogen.sh][./misc/autogen.sh]] from the root
   of this repository.

* Private Init
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CREATED:  [2024-07-20 Sat 20:39]
  :END:

  This section includes a file that is not tracked inside this repository.
  You can either use a submodule, not track the file or use other means to store the file.

  The file in the section is to insert Noweb references (read [[info:org#Noweb Reference Syntax][org#Noweb Reference Syntax]])
  which then can contain information that is inserted by Org-Mode for each induvidual
  reference.

  The file can look for example like this:

  #+begin_src org :tangle no
  ,* Private-Userdata
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CREATED:  [2024-07-20 Sat 22:03]
    :header-args: :tangle no
    :END:

    It's important that all code blocks while are used as noweb referenced are grouped here so they
    are not tangled twice inside ~init.org~, once literally and once as reference.
  ,** Userdata
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CREATED:  [2024-07-20 Sat 21:18]
     :END:

     ,#+NAME: userdata_private
         ,#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (setopt user-full-name "Alice Bob"
           user-mail-address "alice@bob.de")
     ,#+end_src
  #+end_src

  The private init file should contain the following Noweb references
  for this init.el to work:

  - * Userdata
    - userdata_private
  - * Email/PIM
    - gnus_private
  - * SSH-Agent
    - ssh_agent_private
  - * Version Control
    - ** Magit
      - magit_private
    - ** Forge
      - forge_private
  - * Markup-Languages
    - * * Org Packages
      - * * * Org
        - org_mode_private
      - * * * Org-Agenda
        - org_agenda_private
      - * * * Org-Caldav
        - org_caldav_private
  - * Socialmedia

        - bug_mode_private
      - * Debbbugs
        - debbugs_private
    - * Projectile
      - projectile_private

  Items starting with /*/ are sections not noweb-references.

  For an example look at [[file:misc/example_private_init.org]].

  #+INCLUDE: etc/private/init.org

* Emacs Initialization
  We want to use lexical scoping
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :comments nil
  ;;; init.el --- user-init-file                    -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
  #+END_SRC

  Show a few messages with timestamps to get a better overview of how fast
  Emacs is loading certain packages.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar before-user-init-time (current-time)
    "Value of `current-time' when Emacs begins loading `user-init-file'.")
  (message "Loading Emacs...done (%.3fs)"
       (float-time (time-subtract before-user-init-time
    			      before-init-time)))
  #+END_SRC

  We're going to increase the gc-cons-threshold to a very high number to decrease
  the load and compile time.  We'll lower this value significantly after
  initialization has completed. We don't want to keep this value too high or it
  will result in long GC pauses during normal usage.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setopt gc-cons-threshold (* 256 1024 1024))
  #+END_SRC

  Temporarily disable file name handlers as it's not needed on initialization
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar file-name-handler-alist-old file-name-handler-alist)
  (setq file-name-handler-alist nil)
  #+END_SRC

  Increase max number of log messages
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setopt message-log-max 16384)
  #+END_SRC

  Disable certain byte compiler warnings to cut down on the noise. This is a
  personal choice and can be removed if you would like to see any and all byte
  compiler warnings.

  Note: these mostly make sense if its your package or if a package would break soon.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setopt byte-compile-warnings '(not free-vars unresolved noruntime lexical make-local))
  #+END_SRC

 Suppress warnings about lexical binding. Some packages store their data in Elisp
 files without lexical bindings or simply don't use it yet.
 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (setopt warning-suppress-types '((lexical-binding)))
 #+end_src

** Package Management
*** Org config tangle
    There is no ~emacs.el~ in this repo. It will automatically created for you
    from this file (~emacs.org~) when you run ~make build-init~.

    Don't forget to call ~make~ every time you edit this file.
    If this annoys you, you could simply add an ~after-save-hook~ that
    calls ~make~ every time you save this file.

*** Package Settings
    We use borg for package management and disable ~package.el~.

    Since Emacs 27.1 we have to disable package.el in the early init file.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
    (setopt package-enable-at-startup nil)
    #+END_SRC

    But still leave it here so it's also disabled on machines that don't
    have the latest Emacs from master installed.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
    ;; (package-initialize)
    #+END_SRC
    Prefer newer to avoid Emacs loading older byte-compiled files and accidentally
    old code to end up in depending files that are about to be byte-compiled.
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setopt load-prefer-newer t)
    #+end_src


*** System-packages
    Load some Emacs packages installed by the system package manager
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/pdf-tools")
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/lib/emacs/site-lisp")
    #+end_src

*** Company-tng
    company-tng (tab and go) allows you to use TAB to both select a completion candidate from the list and to insert it into the buffer.

    It cycles the candidates like `yank-pop’ or `dabbrev-expand’ or Vim: Pressing TAB selects the first item in the completion menu and inserts it in the buffer.
    Pressing TAB again selects the second item and replaces the inserted item with the second one.
    This can continue as long as the user wishes to cycle through the menu.
